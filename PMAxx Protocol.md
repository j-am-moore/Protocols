# PMAxx Protocol

(1)	Suspend 250 mg of soil in 1000 ul of PBS buffer. Create two reps for each sample (one will receive PMAxx and one won't).

(2)	Add enough PMAxx to half of the samples to create a final solution of 40 uM in a dark room. (dilute 20 mM stock to 2 mM by adding sterile water 1:10; then add 20 ul of 2 mM to each tube)

(3) Add 20 ul sterile NF water to the other half of the samples.

(4)	Vortex for 4 minutes in the dark at room temperature.

(5)	Expose samples to 30 second of 500 watt light and 30 seconds of darkness 4 times while continually vortexing.

(6)	Store treated soil suspensions frozen at -20C.
