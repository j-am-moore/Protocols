Bulk Density
Updated 1-11-19 by Jessica Moore

Purpose of Method: Bulk density is the weight of soil in a given volume. It indicates soil permeability, porosity, and suitability for root and microbial growth. Bulk density tends to vary from 0.6 to 1.8 g/cm3 and most soils are between 1-1.4 g/cm3. 

Materials
Field-moist or dried soil samples
Graduated cylinder, 
balance
drying oven
2 mm sieve

Procedure
1.	Pass a ~ 5 g soil sample through a 2 mm sieve to remove coarse fragments and roots. Collect the soil beneath the sieve into a plastic weigh boat.
2.	 Pour soil sample from the weigh boat into a graduated cylinder. Record the volume of the sample.
3.	Place a metal tin on the balance and weigh. Record the tin ID and the tin weight.
4.	Add the soil to the metal tin and record the weight (wet weight).
5.	Dry the sample in the oven at 105°C for 24-48 h. 
6.	Weigh the dry samples and record the weight. 

Calculations
GWC (gravimetric water content) = (wet weight – dry weight)/(wet weight – tin weight)

Bulk density = [(wet weight of soil) (1-GWC)]/volume of sample

Alternatively, 
Bulk density = (dry weight – tin weight)/volume of sample

Bulk density is reported as g/cm3.
